# Miles Per Gallon

Miles per Gallon is considered to be the average mileage of a motor vehicle which uses Petrol or Diesel as fuel. Miles represents the distance the vehicle traveled in the units of Miles. Write a program to compute a mileage where mileage = miles/gallons.

Output should look something like this:

    Enter traveled miles:
    750
    Enter gallons:
    3
    
    The result is 250.0 miles/gallon
    
Pseudocode:

    BEGIN
        PROMPT: Enter traveled miles
        GET: traveledMiles
        
        PROMPT: Enter gallons
        GET: usedGallans
        
        SET mileage = traveledMiles / usedGallans
        
        Display: "The result is " + mileage + " miles/gallon" 
        
    END
